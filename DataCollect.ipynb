      "\" During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because ?hewould gotten it, if I wanted it.? But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul ? this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports: One of these stories is alie detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads toTrump mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when hedoesn want to admit he lost. Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even thoughBush story reinforced what Trump was saying atrallies had played the ?cash for outcomes? political game foryears could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless ofBushopposition Trump had wanted it. The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bushwould full well known, as would have Trump. Because afterTrumpna attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure.Eichenwald point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or: Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if hehadn been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony issimple wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect. Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater scandalfor half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find. Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlikeTrump other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and hisparty base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth onit head.Trump penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, butit a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President. See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald,there no third option here: Bush: ?The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views onsomething was generous and gave memoney Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.? Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: Ididn? Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and youdidn get it, because I was opposed to? Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before? Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after.I not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people. Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition: A lawyer asked Trump, ?Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?? Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-ElectBush I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida,didn you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But youdidn change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

      "\" Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner oftonight debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States. The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon ? thank you! ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016What curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from ? which will come as quite a surprise: Data is from Trendsmap.comThat right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advancePutin agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya.It a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow.Putin trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences. Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe. The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: ?humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.? So remember ?don trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

      "\" Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying ? and that the shot came from law enforcement. One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: ?Ididn want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.? My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 ? Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016 We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm: I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. ? BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016 ?Ididn realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody saidlet march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said ?Hands Up,Don Shoot,? Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight. ?The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,? Meyer told me almost breathlessly, ?I?ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ?hands up,don shoot? and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.? ?After leaving ?The Epicenter,? police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful ? andthat when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.? Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, ?oh, absolutely.? Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street. ?Itwasn a gunshot,? she told us. ?It was much louder. Itwasn a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ?They just shot him? and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters whohadn already left, exited.? At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters. It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ?entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.? CNN reports, ?Police say the person was shot by a civilian.? The City of Charlotte began spinning theprotester grave injuries immediately on Twitter: ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. ? City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016 Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlottepolice claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist. ?I saw the man go down on the pavement,? said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, ?It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.? Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook ? which was also shared via twitter ? that, ?within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.? When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how ? with more violence.

      "\" NewJersey despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the Bridgegatescandal by a judge, as WNYC reports: The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict. Chris Christie is also RepublicanPresidential nominee DonaldTrump transition team chairperson. Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of theworld busiest bridges. Governor Christie wasTrump most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major conservativeRepublican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended onTrump benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor. Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail.It have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the RepublicanGovernor the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town. Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages. The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about hisadministration bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of thisyear Republican Presidential campaign.

      "\" Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation.He surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes;he being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord. Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. ?For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia? he tweeted in July. Now ? brace yourself, this might come as a shock ? it appearshe been lying to us the whole time. An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has ?numerous ties? to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. ?The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars ? what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate?[and] be associated with Donald Trump? says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group. Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to ?large numbers? of Russian buyers ? so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as ?Little Moscow.? The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion. The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense ? they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth. ?I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personalconsumptiondon read books. Theydon go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht? says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as ?culturalignoramuses interested in social justice.? Sound like anyone we know? When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 followingMoscow annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves ? and Trump himself. ?We?ll be looking at that, yeahwe be looking? said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July. These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all,it that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

      "\" STrump number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in thecompany hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA. Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the FirstAmendment protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel andTrump campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that: According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. ?The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,? the lawsuit says. Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republicannominee most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant.Thiel parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but nowhe supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether. Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be HulkHogan secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing thebillionaire then-secret sexual orientation. But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out theGOP bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, ?Every American has a unique identity.I proud to be gay,I proud to be a Republican,? after a lengthy rant against ?government incompetence.? He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period. Unfortunately, his own partydidn pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s. ?Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,? said the Department ofLabor OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. ?Ournation taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.? Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself vigorouslyand denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News. Now, the executive who accused his employer ? the federal government ? of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that hiscompany hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

      "\"26 SHARES Facebook Twitter A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers. The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person. The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim. St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times. On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.Adan terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday. Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for theterrorist family. The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an ?accomplished student? in high school (but of course). St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who ?happened to be in the right place at the right time.? Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law.That when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him. Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs. Last year the Washington Times reported thatObama administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota. The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls. ?This population is also being targeted by Islamist terror organizations like the Islamic State and al-Shabab, a Somalia-based group with links to al Qaeda, according to U.S. officials.? ?Among Minnesota-based Somali-Americans, American converts to Islam or Somali refugees, there have been numerous convictions for various levels of collaboration with Islamist terror groups, plus reports of fighting with al-Shabab or other Islamist groups.? ?Al-Shabab made a propaganda video warning of an attack on shopping malls around the world, including the Mall of America in Minnesota. Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the terror attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya two years ago, which left 67 dead.? In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape. In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat. ?Pro-Islamic State Somali militants have grown in numbers and are receiving financial and military support from Yemen, a top intelligence official told the VOA Somali Service.? ?He said Islamic State has welcomed its Somalia branch and has started delivering supplies through their affiliate faction in Yemen.? ?They received military supplies from Yemen ? weapons, uniform, ISIS sent trainers who inspected their bases, and they have started sending financial support,? he said. In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS. In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt to join forces to attack America. Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States. If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%. Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.It clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups.It clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota. Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum. Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule. A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.Don vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong. Selah. By Jeff Rainforth Like Jeff on Facebook Follow Jeff on Twitter\"\n",
      "\"A Daisy of a Rerun I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her. The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson approvedthat message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly ?war mongering? opponent, Barry Goldwater. Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisitingJohnson deceitful war policies,Goldwater vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from ourNation media. I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign. Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a Daisyremake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers. Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweighGoldwater 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events. Instead,today voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as ?news and views.? With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, themedia reaction of ridicule was to be expected. Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailingTed ?dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.? This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a ?pathological liar? and ?utterly amoral.? As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of ??Lyin Ted,? insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.? These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder. Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph? Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say derogatorywhen regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the ?liberal press? moniker has now everyday acceptance. It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for thepublic re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation. Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format andr?s of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion. These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections. With that, consider thePresident past considerations oftoday democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, ?She will say anything and change nothing. Hillarycan be trusted andisn qualified to be President.? Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent,it damning, given the time frame. Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: ?If youcan run your own house, you certainlycan run the White House.? Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review. Again,wouldn it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

      "\"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from herdaughter apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at ChelseaClinton apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past. The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type. Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent.Hillary stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does. Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself. The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates? What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton. The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In. It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity. If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential. The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

Idon think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence thatthey an organization for good. The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity: Just 5.7 percent of the ClintonFoundation massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exemptorganization IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and ?other expenses.? The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, theorganization IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as ?other expenses,? while the remaining almost $851K was marked as ?professional fundraising expenses.? Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more ?other expenses? in 2014. Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down. Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, anddoesn appear to want to be president any longer. No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it. As for HillaryClinton health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill.

      "\"Bullets and bodies were flying in Vegas the night of the worst American mass shooting. Blood everywhere. A hotel room with a dead shooter. Two broken windows. Anarmory worth of weapons. A Saudi Crown Prince upstairs. A girlfriend who flew the coup. Nothing adds up to give anyone answers about that horrible shooting in Las Vegas that pinned Stephen Paddock as the lone-wolf shooter responsible for hundreds of deaths and injuries. A mass shooting so bad that one must wonder how one person was able to take out so many unsuspecting concert goers. It makes you wonder if there was more than one shooter. What about that security guard who went missing? What about the rumors that people shot at a tower hoping for an explosion? Was Stephen Paddock the shooter at all? Was his girlfriend Marilou Danley involved? Was she running around outside warning people about something? New evidence leaks from Vegas that has possible crucial information that might lead to more answers the public so desperately seeks. Authorities identified her fingerprints on the ammunition, and her casino card was in the hotel room. That leads people to wonder about her involvement in the crime. Was she ever in that dreaded hotel room? Was the ammo handled at another location? Did Paddock bring her card to throw her under the bus? What part did Danley play in the atrocious shooting? Or was she a patsy? Was Paddock a patsy? Half of the victims of the Las Vegas shooting were not given an autopsy. Why? Trajectory. Number of bullet wounds. Apparently our dead lone shooter Paddock had an over 80% headshot rate. Manliker Carcano No marksman has ever reenacted Dealey successfully with one. ? Bill Chapman Fmr Film Biz Now Truth Seeker (@bchapman151) January 12, 2018 Some investigators crawled throughDanley social media and email accounts. Stephen Paddock reportedly had access to at least one of the accounts in question. More information comes out and maybe one day we can piece this horrible puzzle together. LA Times reports: ?Marilou Danley may not have been present when Paddock unleashed a furious barrage of bullets down on a crowd of 20,000 at a Las Vegas country music festival, killing 58 people and wounding more than 500 others, but her links to his life seemed to be everywhere. The facts about Danley were among the details revealed when a U.S. District Court judge in Las Vegas unsealed more than 300 pages of search warrants and affidavits at the request of several media outlets, including the Los Angeles Times. The request was unopposed by prosecutors. But why the 64-year-old Paddock shot up the Route 91 Harvest festival on Oct. 1 remains a mystery, and the search warrants ? despite revealing his large cache of weaponry ? raise more questions than answers about his actions and motive. Paddock came to Las Vegas with an arsenal ? more than 20 firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition and spent casings were found in his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino. Other search warrants revealed more than 1,000 rounds and 100 pounds of explosive material in his car. Authorities also recovered 18 firearms and more than 1,000 rounds atPaddock house in Mesquite, Nev. A ?large quantity of firearms? was recovered from another residence he had in Reno. The search warrants also covered electronic accounts and social media accounts of Paddock and Danley. They revealed an exchange about a money wire transfer. Danley returned from a trip to the Philippines days after the shooting, butwasn arrested when she arrived in the United States. According to an affidavit, Danley was identified early on ?as the most likely person who aided or abetted Stephen Paddock based on her informing law enforcement that her fingerprints would likely be found on the ammunition used during the attack.? In the court documents, she told investigators she occasionally participated in the loading of the magazines.? Danley loaded magazines on weapons that may have been responsible for a mass amount of bloodshed. Authorities have not arrested her yet, but Danley is a person of interest. My theory is that the authorities are keeping a watchful eye on her to see what she does, who she talks to, and if any of her activity leads people to a much more significant arrest. What was Paddock doing with all those guns in one location? Hecan possibly shoot them all at once, nor would he survive a gunfight with police long enough to use all the ammunition. What were the weapons really for? What wasPaddock real story? Was he a gun runner on a deal that went bad? Was he shot before the shooting started?

      "\"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans? PAC To Take Trump Down A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again? Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough,they funded by Soros TOO!It called ?Common Defense PAC? and their mantra is: ?As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.? Then on the ?leadership team? page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called ?Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.? The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org?s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to ?un-endorse Donald J. Trump.? ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans ?came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.?

      "\"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ?watered-down? HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and ?likely increased? the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,?The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,? was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the ClintonFoundation most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. The congressional report focused onClinton decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company. ?This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and thenation largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,? said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty. ?When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of theFDA approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,? said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company. The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, ?alleged due to thecompany diluted drugs, it ?subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,?? according to the report. ?The question becomes, ?how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,?? asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF. The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate HillaryClinton campaign. Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President BarackObama first term. The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the ClintonFoundation vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the ?watered-down? drugs. ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered ?more than $1.8 million packages.? ?Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,? Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF. Thakur told TheDCNF that many of thecompany anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients. ?These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,? he said.Ranbaxy first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report. The FDA sent a public ?warning letter? to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in thecompany quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, ?show much lower potencies in these batches.? AlthoughRanbaxy generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute thecompany HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad. Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives. Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy. Thakur saidhe now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on accessto patients. The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. ?I have tried to reach out to them,? he told TheDCNF. ?But Ihaven had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.? CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations. Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was ?deeply suspect.? ?In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called CHAIwas by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,? Ortel told TheDCNF. The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order. He signed an executive order that, ?relaxed intellectual property policy standards,? promising the U.S. government ?would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ?Sub-Saharan country? relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,? the report states. CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.CHAI endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under thePresident Emergency Plan for AIDS relief ? a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush. The flow of U.S. funds combined withClinton endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become ?good acquisition targets,? according to the study. Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs. The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they ?exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,? the report states. The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions. One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001. Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial. Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval. Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the ?false hopes? offered by the Clinton Foundation. ?You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To meit disturbing and very sad,? she said. The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com\"\n",

      "\"Ican wait for ?Weekend atChelsea? to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of HillaryClinton slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups ? these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low ? would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a ?minor setback? to her inevitablevictory. The American peoplearen buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more ?conspiracy theory? dismissals. Mrs.Clinton ?mild cold,? er, ?seasonal allergies,? I mean ?heat exhaustion,? that is to say ?minor case of pneumonia? is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a ?mystery man? who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable episodes(or otherwise freezes up with a brain ?short-circuit? during a speech). This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures. Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms ofParkinson disease ? a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has pneumoniarequired a neurological squeeze test?). The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. Theywon, but they should. I wonder what official diagnosiswe?ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as thoughthey been there a hundred times before. ?Nothing to see here, folks. SecretaryClinton sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ?powered through? yesterday going door-to-door.? The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president.She proven, yet again, that shecan be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character.She a liar.That her default mode.She corrupt. Andshe sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else ? including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life. Do I take joy in Mrs.Clinton sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. ?Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice? (Proverbs 24:17). Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of DonaldTrump supporters as a racistand irredeemable?basket of deplorables,? has only served to accelerate the plunge. Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement ? especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her ?friend and mentor.? Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags ? the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.Who the racist?I praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now.

Everythingshe ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BSshe put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, ?Many are the plans in aperson heart, but it is theLORD purpose that prevails.? Am I sayingthere no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up,there always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory. Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for HillaryClinton political aspirations.

Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most peopledon do, to find out the real story ? and the real story is that there is no pay to play. ?It was natural for peoplewho been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things.

      "\"In a shocking, sudden turn of events, one of thecountry most controversial cases that went to court over a year ago has just ended with all charges dropped against this person. Three others involved in this massive news piece have also been exonerated. While there will be much excitement over this stunning decision, there are likely to be riots as well from the opposition. Was justice effective served? It depends on where you stand on the issue of what this crimewas. Barack Hussein Obama was thispatriot biggest nemesis whose orders led to a deadly standoff. With a new president in charge, things have changed dramatically on one of thecountry biggest cases that would have gone much differently had President Donald Trump not been in office. Fox News reports: A federal judge dismissed all charged against rancher Cliven Bundy and three others U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro cited ?flagrant prosecutorial misconduct? in her decision to dismiss all charges against rancher Cliven Bundy, two of his sons and another person. This comes after a standoff two years ago that ended in a court battle that began in October of 2017. Fox explains the unprecedented move made today that was not expected: The embarrassment a federal judge dealt to government prosecutors last month in the Cliven Bundy case could be set to resume Monday, at a hearing to determine whether the cattle rancher who became a folk hero long before he beat the feds can be retried. U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro on Dec. 20 declared a mistrial in the high-profile case. It was only the latest, stunning development in the saga of the Nevada rancher, and served as a repudiation of the federal government. Navarro accused prosecutors of willfully withholding evidence fromBundy lawyers, in violation of the federal Brady rule. The Brady rule, named after the landmark 1963 Supreme Court case known as Brady v. Maryland, holds that failure to disclose such evidence violates adefendant right to due process. ?In this case the failures to comply with Brady were exquisite, extraordinary,? said Fox News legal analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano. ?The judge exercised tremendous patience.? The 71-year-oldBundy battle with the federal government eventually led to what became known as the Bundy standoff of 2014. But it began long before that. In the early 1990s, the U.S. government limited grazing rights on federal lands in order to protect the desert tortoise habitat. In 1993, Bundy, in protest, refused to renew his permit for cattle grazing, and continued grazing his livestock on these public lands. Hedidn recognize the authority of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) over the sovereign state of Nevada. The federal courts sided with the BLM, and Bundydidn seem to have a legal leg to stand on. Nevertheless, the rancher and the government continued this dispute for 20 years, and Bundy ended up owing over $1 million in fees and fines. Things came to a head in 2014, when officials planned to capture and impound cattle trespassing on government land. Protesters, many armed, tried to block the authorities, which led to a standoff. For a time, they even shut down a portion of I-15, the main interstate highway running through Southern Nevada. Tensions escalated until officials, fearing for the general safety, announced they would returnBundy cattle and suspend the roundup. Afterward, Bundy continued to graze his cattle and not pay fees. He and his fellow protesters were heroes to some, but criminals to the federal government. Bundy, along with others seen as leaders of the standoff, including sons Ammon and Ryan, were charged with numerous felonies, including conspiracy, assault on a federal officer and using a firearm in a violent crime. They faced many years in prison. The Bundy case finally began in late October, 2017. But just two months later, it ended with Navarro angry, the feds humiliated and Bundy ? at least to his supporters ? vindicated. In fact, Navarro had suspended the trial earlier and warned of a mistrial when prosecutors released information after a discovery deadline. Overall, the government was late in handing over more than 3,300 pages of documents. Further, some defense requests for information that ultimately came to light had been ridiculed by prosecutors as fantasticaland a ?fishing expedition.? ?Either the government lied or [it?s actions were] so grossly negligent as to be tantamount to lying,? Napolitano said. ?This happened over and over again.? Navarro offered a handful of examples of theprosecution failure to disclose. One had to do with a video showing government surveillance of the Bundy ranch, as well as government snipers, before the standoff. ?Timing is everything when it comes to these documents,? said Napolitano. ?The tapes show that the defendants were telling the truth when they said they brought a militia to the property to protect them from snipers, rather than thegovernment version, which is that the snipers came to protect the government agents from the militia.? Other instances of the government holding back included the failure to produce an internal affairs report on BLM misconduct, which the defense requested and the government denied existed, and threat assessments by federal agents declaring the Bundys were not likely to use violence. ?The court does regrettably believe a mistrial in this case is the most suitable and only remedy,? Navarro said in declaring a mistrial. Ammon and Ryan Bundy were arrested. LaVoy Finicum was dead. The standoff in Oregon between ranchers and the federal government seemed to be at an end as the leaders of the revolt had either been killed, or were in custody. Four holdouts remained at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in eastern Oregon, though. Negotiations were underway for their surrender. The son of famed preacher Billy Graham, Franklin Graham, said he would meet with the four holdouts at the national refuge, presumably to bring the revolt which has captivated Americans nationwide to a peaceful resolution. Elected officials joined in the fray, telling the holdouts to ?stay alive? so their story could be told. While this was happening, Cliven Bundy announced he would come to Oregon to bolster the holdouts stand against the federal government. As the holdouts somehow managed to break an FBI blockof internet and cell communications, and stream audio, and video of what was happening, Cliven Bundy landed at Portland International Airport, and was immediately surrounded by SWAT teams. USA Today reports that the elderly rancher was arrested, and booked into Multnomah County Jail. Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy has been arrested after flying into Portland International Airport. The father of Ammon Bundy, the leader of the occupation at an Oregon wildlife refuge, was detained by the FBI and booked into Multnomah County Jail on Wednesday night, theprison records show. A post on BundyRanch Facebook page said: ?Cliven Bundy just landed in Portland; we are being told by eyes on ground that he was surrounded by SWAT and DETAINED.? The 74-year-old, who intended to travel to Burns, close to the wildlife refuge, faces federal charges related to a standoff at his ranch in 2014, The Oregonian reported. The newspaper said he faces a charge of conspiracy to interfere with a federal officer and weapons charges. The elderly Bundy was good friends with Arizona rancher LaVoy Finicum, who was killed by authorities during the Oregon standoff. During the standoff, Finicum told reporters that he just wanted to go home. Finicum was a foster parent to 4, and hosted 50 foster children at his ranch in Arizona. Finicum explained in a video why he disliked the federal government so much. The Bureau of Land Management stole his water. The ?Oregon Standoff? began because Amanda Marshall, an Obama appointee for U.S. attorney for Oregon, recommended that the government sentence Oregon rancher Dwight Hammond and his son, Steven Hammond as terrorists for a controlled burn on their land which reached federal land.

      "\"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a ?powerful hate group,? has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available. As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is thisauthor contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get ?Hillary the Horrible? into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election. A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone ? especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President ? to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud. The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters ? but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens ? to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America. Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible. Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party,America most powerful ?Hate Group,? not only wants ?Hillary the Horrible? to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed. Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

      "\"Michelle Obama NOT Leaving The White House ? Hillary Clinton Has Terrifying New Role For Her!?!? The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election. What exactly is First Lady MichelleObama legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous ?for the first time in my lifeI proud of my country.? I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her ?#BringBackOurGirls? sign. But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration? *insert mechanical applause here* But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?It not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children.

Buy Now I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children? For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her faithand how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology. Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post. Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. ?I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,? she said. ?I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.? This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the ?Idon like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas? vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something. Either way,I absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen.\"\n",
      "\"Michigan has become a hotbed of hate as Muslims have been allowed to take over much of the state and impose their ?religious rights? on everyone who was there before them. After years of this infiltration, fueled in large part by BarackObama refugee program and the town of Dearborn becoming the Middle East of Michigan, citizens have had enough. The entitled ride of thinking they can take over has just come to an abrupt end with the rude awakening they just faced by one brave individual leading the charge of making the state American again. The nature of the Islamic religion does not allow Muslims to assimilate into Western culture ? they want to dominate it since everything America stands for is counter to their beliefs. Michigan has systematically been forced to bow down to Islam under the pressure of our previous president who herded thousands of refugees into their state and allowed one town, in particular, to become unrecognizable as an American city ? Dearborn ? which looks more like the Middle East with its predominately Muslim population of approximately 103,000, according to WXYZ. Muslims? plan is world domination asthat what their holy book preached for them to achieve. Key to that plan is the implementation of Sharia Law which they try to slowly establish under the radar here in America, without anyone realizing it beforeit too late. Wise to their disguise is Michigan Representative Michele Hoitenga whoisn taking a backseat to political correctness and just got proactive about stopping Muslims in their tracks with a nasty surprise she just slapped them with. With a new president in charge, states are starting to feel empowered to take assertive action against Islam in America, as was seen this week by what Hoitenga who just proposed a bill to ban Sharia Law. MLive reports: ?Michigan residents would be banned from using other countries? laws in court under a bill proposed by Rep. Michele Hoitenga, R-Manton, according to an email obtained by MLive. In an email sent to state lawmakers seeking co-sponsors on Monday, Hoitenga said her billdoesn specifically mention Sharia Law, but wrote that it would include the religious law association with Islam. ?If you have not heard by now, a doctor in Detroit is being charged with operating an underground clinic that actively engaged in genital mutilation on young girls, essentially practicing a fundamentalist version of Sharia Law,? Hoitenga wrote in the email.?Hoitega timingcouldn have been more important as she saw first-hand the horrific results of Islam and Sharia Law in her own state last week when a female doctor was arrested for what she had been doing to Michigan girls who were not Muslim. Federal prosecutors accused 44-year-old Muslim Dr. Jumana Nagarwala of performing female genital mutilation on unsuspecting little girls in her Detroit-area E.R. As expected, Hoitega faces an uphill battle with this bill in getting it past state Democrats who must not see a problem in disturbing crimes like Dr.Nagarwala who was forcing the sickest part of her religion on little girls. Hoitega wants to prevent more of this from being acceptable by law, whichshouldn be up for debate sinceit completely contradictory to the U.S. Constitution, which liberals love to ignore. Had this been a measure to prevent any other religion from gaining dominance over people, Democrats would be demanding that it pass and wreaking havoc on city streets if they were denied. We reported before that Michigan is under a siegeof Muslims as was captured by an undercover journalist with a video camera. A siege is currently taking place slowly and quietly, making a casualty of one city at a time. The first city to fall is Hamtramck, Michigan. But soon after it will be Dearborn. Michigan. And before we even know it, the whole nation will surrender our values, morals, and freedoms in the name of humanityand ?tolerance. Detroit Free Press Reports: Hamtramck residents have elected a Muslim majority to thecity six-member city council, symbolizing the demographic changes that have transformed the city once known for being a Polish Catholic enclave. InTuesday election ? with six candidates running for three seats ? the top three vote-getters were Muslim, while the bottom three were non-Muslim. Two of the Muslim candidates, Anam Miah and Abu Musa, are incumbent city councilmen, while newcomer Saad Almasmari, the top vote-getter, also was elected. The seat of another Muslim incumbent councilman, Mohammed Hassan, was not up for re-election, and incumbent City Councilman Robert Zwolak came in fifth place. Some believe the city is the first in the U.S. with a Muslim majority on its city council. Four of the six council members will be Muslim: three of them of Bangladeshi descent and one Yemeni. ?Hamtramck has made history,? said Hamtramck community leader Bill Meyer. ?The election was far from close, with the three Muslim winners each gaining over 1,000 votes, while the other three candidates garnered less than 700 votes each.? Councilman Musa, who came in second place, told the Free Press that he will work to represent everyone in the city regardless of background. ?I?m a very good Muslim,? said Musa, an immigrant from Bangladesh. ?I try my best to pray five times (a day), but when I get elected, every single ethnic votes for me, not (only) the Muslim vote for me, but Christians, every single ethnic group, African-Americans, Polish.I a good friend of the Polish.? ?I represent every single citizen in Hamtramck,? he said. ?I?m serving all city of Hamtramck.? Formerly known for its Polish population, Hamtramck is now about 24% Arab (mostly Yemeni); 19% African American; 15% Bangladeshi; 12% Polish; and 6% Yugoslavian (many Bosnian), according to U.S. Census figures. The percentage of residents who are Muslim is unclear since the U.S. Census does not ask about religion. Estimates of the Muslim population range from one-third to more than one-half of city residents. Almost all of the Yemeni Americans in Hamtramck are Muslim, while the growing Bangaldeshi-American community in Hamtramck has Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. The city has a Bangladeshi Hindu temple and Bangladeshi mosques. On Friday, Gov. Rick Snyder attended the opening of Bangla Town, an area that will celebrate Bangladeshi-American culture in Hamtramck and bordering Detroit neighborhoods. About 41% of the city are immigrants, the highest percentage among cities in metro Detroit. Pope John Paul II, who was Polish, visited Hamtramck in 1987; a statue of him commemorating his visit is in a city park. Three of the Muslims onHamtramck City Council are of Bangladeshi descent, while Almasmari is of Yemeni descent. Thecouncil only other Arab-American Muslim in its history was Abdul Algazali, who died in February. The issue of Islam has sometimes come up in recent years as the Muslim population grows. After contentious debate, the city allowed in 2004 the Muslim call to prayer to be broadcast publicly five times a day from mosques through loudspeakers. The call to prayer has drawn complaints from residents who sayit loud and intrusive, waking them up early and bothering them. City Council candidate Susan Dunn, who came in fourth place, raised the issue during the campaign, prompting a response from Almasmari during a city council meeting last month. ?We all want to live peacefully and respectfully,? he said to the council during the October meeting, according to a video he posted to his Facebook account. ?Our special thing is ? the diversity in this town.? Almasmari said the call to prayer ?is not as loud as (Dunn) thinks.? Moreover, if ?we are considering the call to prayer as noise,? then so would ?the loud music all night long while we are sleeping.? ?We as Muslims respect our neighbors and wedon like to bother anybody,? he said. ?As the Prophet Mohammed said: he who believes in Allah and the last day, let him not harm his neighbors.? Meyer, who is not Muslim, said that Muslims in Hamtramck ?have helped bring stability, security and sobriety while lessening the amount of drugs and crime in the city.? h/t: [AmericanLookout]\"\n",

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with Clintonin it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed ?watered-down? HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this? the question is, did the Clintons know about it.I betting that they did. Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this. ?This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and thenation largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,? said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty. From The Daily Caller: Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ?watered-down? HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and ?likely increased? the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,?The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,? was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the ClintonFoundation most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. ? 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now The congressional report focused onClinton decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. ?The question becomes, ?how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,?? asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF. This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the ClintonFoundation aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the ?watered-down? drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money. ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered ?more than $1.8 million packages.? ?Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,? Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.Ranbaxy generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation andClinton charity have not severed ties with them either. Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant. Bill and Hillary Clinton obviously care nothing about black people or humans in general? their primary interest is monetary.\"\n",

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process. ?There?s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, theywon know the law, andthey be engaging in discriminatory challenges,? Gitlin said. ?That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.? As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim. Andthat exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants. ?We?re going to watch Pennsylvania,? Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. ?Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other peopledon come in and vote five times. If you do that,we not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion ? I really mean this, Pennsylvania ? is if cheating goes on.? Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to ?Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!? In response toTrump claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage. With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly inTrump favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else. Featured Image: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images\"\n",

One of the most famous is probably ?read mylips new taxes,? a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat: Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. Hedidn promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.Let imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. Destroydoesn?t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty ?yeeeeehaw,? the reality is thathe talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America.He talking about profiling Muslims.He talking about DonaldTrump version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example,isn just a Muslim,he an The man being hunted by the FBI, for example,isn just a Muslim,he an American citizen with the right to due process. Just becausehe a suspect in a bombingdoesn meanhe guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked killand not on the most wanted list.There nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play. What that means is that underTrump dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you thinkI being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. Itisn about the narrative. Itisn about prevention or education.It about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening. The only solace we have is that whathe promising is nothing but another ?read my lips.? Terrorismisn something you can simply destroyjust because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but itisn going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism.

      "\"Share Tweet Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human: According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that theydon end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities. Case in point. The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and achild genitals, so ifyou a parent of a child andyou changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath,you a felon. For real. This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from ?intentionally or knowingly touching? the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because theydon know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids. The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that ?prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.? They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right? In others words, just trust the prosecutors,y.There no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them. Wow. There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. Buthere an especially interesting tidbit: As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, themajority logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state SupremeCourt help,Arizona child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent orcaregiver of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of thestate residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended forArizona parents and caregivers. Yikes. ButI sureit all just work itself out.

      "\"She?s on a warpath right now andit tearing up Twitter and social media outlets as we speak. This day is all about the survivor and the attacker and a day in remembrance of what happened in the90.It being considered as a terrible attack that happened in the White House that left a youngwoman reputation damaged and a President impeached. This is the story of Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky andshe celebrating her 20th year of that horrible time in American politics. The White House was disgraced. Awoman dress defaced. And everyone in the world had their eyes on the White House as an impeachment process added to the fledgling reputation of former President Bill Clinton. Monica Lewinsky claimsshe a survivor after what happened with her sexual encounter with Bill Clinton. Some call it an attack. Some call it mutual. Everyone calls it repulsive because Bill Clinton was caught in a raunchy expose with an intern while he was married to Hillary Clinton. But Hillarydidn leave his side. She stayed on the path of politics, not caring much about what her husband was into (or putting into) and she usedBill name and reputation to push her career forward while he took a back seat after his romp with Lewinsky. Bill Clinton was probed 20-years ago and the memory and backlash of the sexual encounter have always left a stain on the reputation of Lewinsky. Thatdidn stop her from being successful in her ventures after the impeachment of Bill Clinton. She refused to allow the incident with the former President of the United States to stop her in on the path to success. She pushed forward, full steam ahead, and she brandished herself a survivor. Shewasn physically attacked with punches, kicks, or weapons, but her character was nearly assassinated. She went from being an intern to a name everyone knows. People know her, her dress, and something about cigars that wewon get into. And now, still, Lewinsky pushes on as she claims herself a survivor from what was possibly her most tumultuous year. Gateway Pundit reports: ?Twenty years ago today Special Counsel Kenneth Starr contacted Attorney General Janet Reno to get permission to expand his probe of Bill Clinton. Janet Reno agreed and submitted the request to a panel of three federal judges. The judges agree to allow Starr to formally investigate the possibility of subornation of perjury and obstruction of justice in the Jones case. Tripp and Lewinsky meet again at the Ritz-Carlton. FBI agents and U.S. attorneys intercede and take Lewinsky to a hotel room, where they question her and offer her immunity. Lewinsky contacts her mother, Marcia Lewis, who travels down from New York City by train. Lewis contacts her ex-husband, who calls attorney William Ginsburg, a family friend. Ginsburg advises her not to accept the immunity deal until he learns more. Three days later, an January 19, 1998, Matt Drudge at The Drudge Report broke the story first on the Monica Lewinsky Scandal. And that led to the impeachment vote of President Bill Clinton.? Is the combination of Matt Drudge and Monica Lewinsky the reason for BillClinton impeachment? Perhaps as a secondary reason. The true reason for BillClinton impeachment is Bill Clinton himself. His inability to remain distant from Monica Lewinsky, regardless of who approached who is the sole reason an impeachment was ever more than an idea. If he allowed himself to be in close quarters and inadvertently in a sexual encounter with an intern, then the full blame must be placed on him. Citizens have extremely high standards for the President of the United States of America and sexual encounters with an intern are not on the unwritten list of approved behaviors. Monica Lewinsky shared her 20-year anniversary Tweet and it began a chain of survivor Tweets.It a great story to see her posting positive messages to the public. However, we must remember that it takes two to tango. Since she was an intern, then it must have been theworld biggest accomplishment to ?hook up? with the President. But for Bill Clinton, he let down his wife, his country, and his intern when he allegedly engaged in sexual activity. Bill Clinton should have said NO so that Monica Lewinskydidn have to say #MeToo. Butlet not forget ? the encounter with Bill Clinton was only the beginning.Don forget what Hillary did to try and ruin her life. Hillary may not have slept with Monica Lewinsky, but Mrs. Clinton is very capable of doing a lot of other things. Monica has gotten off easy.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad.

ObviouslyObama dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a JVteam and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error. However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi. And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports. However whatisn in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

Fox News reports: An attorney for the co-founder of opposition research firm Fusion GPS revealed during a closed-door interview this summer with congressional investigators that ?somebody?s already been killed? as a result of the publication of the anti-Trump dossier. The statement was contained in a 312-page transcript of Fusion GPS co-founder GlennSimpson August interview with committee investigators, released unilaterally Tuesday by Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. The release itself provoked controversy, with an aide to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, calling it confoundingfor Feinstein to drop the transcript in the ?middle of an ongoing investigation.? Among the many revelations in the document, though, is the claim fromSimpson attorney that someone died because the dossier ? which was commissioned by Fusion GPS ? was publicly released. ?He wants to be very careful to protect his sources,? attorney Josh Levy said during the Aug. 22 Senate Judiciary Committee interview of his client. ?Somebody?s already been killed as a result of the publication of this dossier and no harm should come to anybody related to this honest work.? Levydidn elaborate on who was killed. The website BuzzFeed first published the dossier online last January, airing its unverified allegations about PresidentTrump connections with Russia. The dossier was written by former British MI6 agent Christopher Steele. Fusion GPS, which hired Steele, got funding from the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. Trump has long derided the dossier as politically motivated, and several GOP-led committees are investigating whether it formed the basis for theFBI initial investigation into Russian election interference. Feinstein said in a statement she released the transcript to combat misinformation about the interview. ?The innuendo and misinformation circulating about the transcript are part of a deeply troubling effort to undermine the investigation into potential collusion and obstruction of justice,? Feinstein said in a statement. ?The only way to set the record straight is to make the transcript public.? Although the attorneyisn naming any names of who has ?already been killed,? the only person who is suspected of having info on this particular dossier was Seth Rich. Rich was murdered in Washington, D.C. on July 10, 2016, ofwhat being said as a robbery gone deadly. However, a lot of information seems to suggest that cause is nearly impossible. Now, with this latest statement out, the pieces to the puzzle of his suspicious death are starting to come together. This latest assertion that someone has now been killed over the dossier could and should very well be the smoking gunwe been waiting for, which Trump knew was coming. By nowit starting to be very clear that Democratic National CommitteeStaffer death was the cause of some foul play. So clear that we can now add the former candidate and Speaker of the House NewtGingrich name to the list of those calling for an official investigation into the so-called ?Botched Robbery? which ended in the murder of Rich. Gingrich explained: ?We have this very strange story now of this young man who worked for the Democratic National Committee, who apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments,? ?Nobody?s investigating that, and what does that tell you aboutwhat going on? Because it turns out, itwasn the Russians. It was this young guy who, I suspect, was disgusted by the corruption of the Democratic National Committee.He been killed, and apparently, nothing serious has been done to investigate his murder. SoI like to see how Robert S. Mueller III is going to define what his assignment is.?It currently being reported that the real source of the Democrat Party email leaks was never the Russians. It was actually the 27-year-old Democrat staffer Seth Rich, who strongly favored the Socialist Bernie Sanders over Crooked Hillary Clinton in the Democrat Primaries. When he learned of the shenanigans and rigging that was taking place against Senator Sanders he managed to get proof of what the DNC was up to. He then went on to report his findings anonymously to the website ?Wikileaks.? Jullian Assange has practically confirmed this whole narrative.What even stranger is how the Rich family was calling for an investigation after the official investigation turned up the narrative that it was just a robbery gone wrong. A robbery were no belongings were taken. Not his expensive watch, wallet or even the phone he was using to talk to his girlfriend at the moment of the robbery. Interestingly enough they have now changed their tunes and what no investigation nor mention of the mystery behindSeth death. If Ididn know better I would start to believe they were threatened or something of the sort.\"\n",
      "\"There?s a lot to be discussed about lastnight debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

      "\"There?s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable ? except by Hillary Clinton. But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong: While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics ?. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage. After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates. The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters: For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator ? to call out those lies and to do that in real time. Unfortunately, withTrump impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods,it somehow up to Hillary Clinton to shineat the debate if she hopes to ?win.? This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent. Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it. If there is one thing this election has shown us,it that journalism is dying, if not already dead. Featured image via Sara D. Davis/Getty Images\"\n",
      "\"They were searching for years. It finally happened. They eventually found their onetrue gem after lastyear failure. Now after years of searching, liberals finally feel likethey seen a woman who can win the Presidency. Ironically, the notion to find a TV star candidate was stolen from the fact that President Trump had a bit of a TV career to go along with the rest of his business ventures.It also not lost on anyone that there are no two names more synonymous with wealth in America than Donald Trump and Oprah Winfrey.It quite funny that people on the left kept spouting off that youcan have a television billionaire run for President ? but now they have their television billionaire they want to run for President. Funny how that works, right? The left has literally copied exactly what the right does becausethey unable to craft their own winning strategy. Liberals have found PresidentTrump antithesis and plan to run her against him in the next presidential election of 2020. Winfrey is also boosted by the fact that she has a couple of social justice warrior bonus points working in her favor;she black, andshe a she. She has everything that they said Hillary had, but without that annoying and predatory Bill tagging along for the free ride. The one other thing that Oprah has in common with President Trump is that her careerhasn been in politics. Shehasn had to look over her shoulder and watch her mouth for her entire life.She just been giving out prizes from under the seats of her show set and participating in other business ventures that have nothing to do with politics. In the case of President Trump, thatdidn matter too much, because hewasn running on a platform of political correctness.That where they differ. Oprah would most likely be on the plan with political correctness, something that America has gotten sick of hearing about. Oprah has given numerous honest and very liberal opinions over the years, and that is now coming back to haunt her. To make matters worse, the bumbling mainstream media is jumping up to defend her, andit not going well.It scary to think of Oprah Winfrey in the Oval Office as anything more than a guest taking a tour. Her unashamed opinion on race issues and disdain for white people could be a problem. The longtime TV host has become increasingly anti-white over the years, to the point thatshe handing down a proverbial death sentence to those whodon agree with her. Her idea is that racism is a problem of the past, so to fix the problem, those who lived in that time just need to die.That right folks. It was a horrible thing she said, and this video would be the bane of her existence if she ever ran for President. Oprah said as much in an interview in 2013: Oprah's solution to racism; Old white people \"\"just have to die\"\". What a horribly divisive message. pic.twitter.com/NOtaft2xxf ? Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) January 8, 2018 Aren't old people most of her audience? She would be out of a job if this happened. ? Frank Lea ?? (@TrendingViews1) January 15, 2018 Wow! For a billionaire there could have been a more \"\"eloquent \"\" way to say this. Money doesn't buy class. ? Kim (@KimKing2018) January 8, 2018It difficult to see someone who is considered to be a national leader asking for the death of hundreds of thousands of Americans.It even more painful to think people would want her to run the country with that attitude. Now, to be fair,she probably right about a small fraction of the older generation. There will always be at least a few people who say racially inappropriate things, but they do not stand for or represent the majority of our good Americans. Even if there are a few old cronies with a racist bone in their body, thatdoesn mean everyone is like that. That alsodoesn mean Oprah should call for a mass genocide of old white people. That is a terrible and racist thing to say. It makes Oprah look like the black female Hitler who calls for the killing of a particular kind of people. Is that who the American people would want to vote for? Idon think so. It is NOT EVER OK to suggest that Americans try to kill people off just because they disagree with someone. What Oprah said is unforgivable and disgusting. We cannot believe she would say anything like that. This probably seems exceptionally radical, based on what she just said, that someone would try to kill an old person becausethey racist, butit perhaps not as far-fetched as you might think. Currently, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington have ?death with dignity? laws that allow a terminally ill patient to voluntarily request and receive a prescription medication to hasten their death. This practice is also called euthanasia, which is a term that encompasses any physician-assisted suicide, and it dates back as far as ancient Greece and Rome. The United States is beginning to accept the reasoning that a person might need to die before their natural time, based strictly on the quality of life. Right now, as with most of the new technologies offered to us,it optional. If we decide that our lifeisn worth living, we can end it. However, throughout most of history, ithasn been the patient choosing whether to pull their plug. In a socialist society, whereit all for one and one for all, someone always has to decide what will be for the ?greater good.? In fact, Euthanasia comes from the Greek words, Eu (good) and Thanatosis (death) and it means ?Good Death, ?Gentle and Easy Death.? This word is used for ?mercy killing.? Withdrawal or with-holding treatment was practiced in history, the correct term for this is orthothanasia, which means ?passive death.? If you combine that with the incredibly scary, and over-reaching liberties taken in the Affordable Care Act (aka, Obamacare), then you can see how we were (and maybe still are) a hop, skip and a jump from the government choosing who lives and dies. If racism is considered cancer that should be cut out, then racism is redefined to mean anything liberals want, they would be able to hand down a death sentence to anyone the government wanted, by withdrawing care. ?Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.? That is what we were promised in the constitution, butwe now come full circle to the point where we need to depend on another truth given to us by a founding father: We must, indeed, all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately. ?

      "\"WellTHAT Weird. If the Birther movement is racist? does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama? What if that person is ? Obama? Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ??Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate? That was June 2004. Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.It still out there on the internet.Here a screen capture:Here the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution. And the link to the original.That not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991. That wasObama publicist.Here the quote: Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by BarackObama then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as ?born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.? The booklet, which was distributed to ?business colleagues? in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotesObama anticipated first book, Journeys in Black andWhite Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead. If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain? If his birth in America is valid ? as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the foreignercard gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of ? whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly. Because if ThatWASN a lie? then something else MUST be. That ?something else? being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency. The quote can be read in context at Breitbart.\"\n",

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led ?to a collision of cultures? but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization. Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows. ?I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,? Obama said. ?In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.?

Buy Now A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through. That seems very bizarre considering thatwe seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go? Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone. While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun. The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination. This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through?\"\n",
      "\"With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno believeswe reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point. Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; ?The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.\"\" However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from thepresident astounding incompetence,there also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers. The General went on to explain; \"\"Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,\"\" Odierno said. \"\"Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.\"\" The Army has cut 80,000 soldiers out of the active force, reorganized and cut 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades from the active component.
